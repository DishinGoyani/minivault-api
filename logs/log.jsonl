Unlike classical computers which use bits (which can only be either 0 or 1), quantum computers use quantum bits, or qubits, which can exist in multiple states simultaneously. This allows quantum computers to perform certain types of calculations much faster than traditional computers. For example, a single qubit can perform a calculation that would take many millions of years for a classical computer to do. Quantum computers have the potential", "response_length": 599}
